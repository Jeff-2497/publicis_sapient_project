# Market, Users, Prototype

## Understand Your Market
*Provide links to the 3 websites you explored* 
- https://www.airbnb.com/
- https://www.vrbo.com/?pwaDialog=customer-notification-centered-sheet-dialog
- https://www.bluepillow.com/

*Briefly explain why these websites are a relevant comparison* 
Airbnb, VRBO, and BluePillow are all relavent comparisons to Marriott Homes and Villas because at their fundementals they all provide the same service: a space online where people can make reservations for housing throughout this conuntry and around the world. What makes them different is the way each of them go about it, but fundamentally they are the same, which makes them relevant comparisons. 

*List at least 10 product features*
- a user can rewards on vacation rentals in their app
- a user can search by region (big image + words of region)
- a user can choose how many people will be in their party in the search menu
- a user has the option to compare prices with other popular booking sites
- a user can view the most trending homes/destinations
- a user has the option to add rentals to a liked list
- a user can use an interactive map that displays all the relevant listings to their search query
- a user can leave reviews on the places they've stayed at before
- a user can share any listing with the most popular methods
- a user can use a scalable price range which also shows the quantity of homes for said prices in a bar chart spaced accordingly above the price range



## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*
I have an exact destination in mind 24.21%

I know what type of vacation I want, but haven't settled on a destination 38.67%
- second case study
I know what area or country I want, but haven't settled on a destination 9.68%

I have no idea yet, looking for inspiration 27.44%
- first case study

    What connections can you identify between qualitative (video) and quantitative (survey results) research?
    What are some of the ‚Äúpain points‚Äù (tensions or frustrations) users are describing as they interact with the Marriott website?
  
    - not knowing half the locations recomended on homepage (both case studies) (2nd wants a hover over for pop destinations so there isnt a need to click on each individual location)
    - rather know whats around the location (activities) instead of admenities on homepage
    - map is overwelming when searching by intial location also shows way more than the user asked (other homes in different states other than searched one)
    - dropdown for navbar so popular destinations could be viewed
    - rather filter by vacation type then state instead of starting with every state first (overwelming)
    - wants a luxerious beach house for a girls trip, she would rather search by the "vibe" of the trip and be given locations that fall into that category cause at the moment she has to manually go through by exact destination and that takes a lot more time.


    What kind of experience do you think users wish for?
    - a more prominent feature that gives more inspiration to those not knowing where they want to go yet


Tip: Start your paragraph with: ‚ÄúThe user research suggests that‚Ä¶‚Äù

The user research suggests that there are connections between the qualitative and quanitative research. Both of the case studies fall under the two most common answers to the question:"When thinking about your next vacation, do you know your destination?" With both case studies there were multiple pain points that the users voiced. The main one that overlapped between both of them was the fact that when searching for a vacation the results were always too overwelming and didn't really have what they were looking for. They wished there was alternate intial search features that started with what type of vacation and show places based off that rather than having to go specifically by location. After viewing the two case studies and seeing the current main features of Homes and Villas website it's clear it's optimized towards people who either know an exact destination in mind or know what area or country they want. This is troubling considering they make up the two lowest demographics of the sample population taken from Homes and Villas userbase. Therefore, there needs to be a major change to the intial search features of Homes and Villas website, so they can more properly accomidate their largest demographics.
